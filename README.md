# Juliet
 
Juliet is a sequence to sequence encoder decoder model aiming to incorporate NMT archiectures to positionally encode patterns which can be used to aid in the classification of vulnerable segments of code. 

Juliet has been trained using a novel dataset collected from NIST, is mutli-lingual and represents a large variety of semantically connected code files containing over 20 CWE's. We seek to publish this set of positional encodings as an aid for those wishing to apply language modeling techniques to improve vulnerability forecasting. 

This will be updated upon completion of the NASA sponsored research fellowship, the WVSGC, in 2024, a full report of which will be included.
